QR CODE READER COVID

This project is coded in flutter dart programming language so the project aim is to generate what ever the user type then it generate a QR-CODE for it. When the form is needed then directly we can scan the qr-code so it will redirect to the form page 

By this the pandemic time the use of pens and paper in market and other office are partially used so using this the user can directly fetch the form by just scanning it.
